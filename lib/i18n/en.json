  "landDescription1": "Monsolis, The Versed Mountains\n\nThe largest mountains ever seen create the landscape of Monsolis. With no distinction between the mountain top, and the sky, there is a sense of calm across this region. The fresh air and stillness bring relief from the constant sounds of Battle.\n\nAll over its land, the indestructible stone tells a story. Carved into its face, is the history of Ereo, told through poetry, songs and epics, all written by its original inhabitant, Toruk.\n\nA beauty to be seen are the towering mountains of Monsolis",
  "landDescription2": "Above it all, where air currents are the strongest, you find a sanctuary, with floating islands, suspended by an unknown, supernatural force.\n\nAlthough the windiest place in Ereo, Kosol remains a deeply connected ecosystem, fit for those who crave adventure. Only those able to fly can take advantage of this wonderful sanctuary.\n\nFor the ones that do, we call them the privileged few. From this height you get to see everything. The whole world of Ereo, all its ongoing battles, its life.",
  "landDescription3": "Darkwater roots. The trees that drink from the muddy waters of this region rise high above the world, transforming the swamps of Ereo. Its entangled unpredictable woods are a reflection of its dwellers. Find them crawling the floor, hiding in the shadows, seeking solace where they can find it.\n\nOne such resident is Mali. Scattered everywhere are their statues, placed as a symbol of self love, declaring this ominous marshy land as their haven for self obsession.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the serene and quiet aspects of Sejuri, there’s always a predator watching, ready to attack.",
  "landDescription4": "Spewing lava and lightning from it’s peak, K’rhon creates deadly red molten rivers. Its heat, and the rumbles from its eruptions can be felt from miles away.Spewing lava and lightning from it’s peak, K’rhon creates deadly red molten rivers. Its heat, and the rumbles from its eruptions can be felt from miles away.\n\nThe lands around the volcanoes are lifeless, no creature, plant or CryptoTitan can live this close to the heat.\n\nA deep fog that no sunlight can pass through, has settled in K’rhon, making it the darkest place in all of Ereo. In a constant state of calamity, K’rhon is home only to those created by its fire.",
  "landDescription5": "Gunorth, the Wooden Fortress, called so because of the vast amount of soaring trees in this region. So serene, the tree trunks act as a natural hiding spot for the CryptoTitans, a perfect space for those that love nature.\n\nNature, however, not always protected, shows the conflict between the Titans and Gunorth written all over its trunks. Tree markings act as proof, signs, that even in the serene places, Korak’s weapons will still swing.",
  "landDescription6": "The underwater land of Ereo is different. Thalos is different. Unlike much of Ereo, this ecosystem lives in harmony.\n\nThe coral, fish, and predators keep the balance, and take care of the ocean, understanding its rhythm and its qualities as part of their home. The crashing waves of Thalos bring a sense of peace to the inhabitants of the sea, while instilling fear in the creatures of the land.\n\nBut, beware while navigating these waters, the Titans who have the courage to wade through Thalos are not to be taken lightly.",
  "landDescription7": "Underground in the dark, damp, endless tunnels of Ereo, coated in a sticky venomous substance and filled to the brim with peril for travelers, is the home of Vespir, Mikrothos.\n\nIts living walls of insects are constantly shifting its archeology, and configuration of pathways. Whenever you are in Mikrothos, don’t stand still for too long, for you will be trapped in an underground swarm.",
  "landDescription8": "When you reach the everlasting dunes within Ereo, you have arrived at Kortos, the original settlement of Balig. In a world of two extremes; blinding light, and unforgivable darkness, living in the dunes is no easy task.\n\nTrying to survive, one can wane from hunger, and thirst, not to mention the burning scorching sunlight. Only the night sand is of refuge, letting the creatures cool before the day comes around again. Battling only at night is the unwritten rule for the treacherous lands of Kortos.",

  "loreChapter1Description": "Before there was Ereo, there were the Elementals, here since the beginning of time and before all things were born. They are omnipotent beings with the power to mould universes, build worlds, and craft organisms with the strength toliberateor destroy. Elementals birth life by merely thinking it into existence. <br />  <br /> Sick and tired of the cold darkness of the universe, the Elementals craved colours! They crafted a planet full of life, sprouting plants, water, and land masses. They danced with joy and excitement. Their imagination fuelled such beautiful things.",
  "loreChapter2Description": "Noticing these deviating thoughts, the Elementals used all their power to craft four ultimate warriors to keep an eye on things. They became known as the Titans of Order. Exhausted, the Elementals fell into a deep slumber. Existence was now in the hands of the Titans.",
  "loreChapter3Description": "Forged from the elements and land, Titans have become one with their landscapes - informing their evolving personality, fighting style, and appearance. On guard and ready, the Titans of Order continually train to hone their strengths and skills.<br /> <br /> Outnumbered but still intent on creating a world with Chaos, Existence knew it had to build its own army of Titans. An army bent on clashing with the idyllic Titans of Order. ",
  "loreChapter4Description": "Molded from the darkest depths of Existence, out emerged the four Titans of Chaos whose ideology was rooted in havoc, destruction, and revolution against an Order that ceased to serve them. These original eight Titans of Order and Chaos became known as the PRIMORDIALS.<br /> <br /> Forgetting what befell the Elementals earlier, Existence went into a dormant state. War ensued between Order and Chaos, rocking the world to its very core...",
  "loreChapter5Description": "Everything lay in waste: the Existence the Titans of Order swore to protect was destroyed; the Order that the Titans of Chaos fought to overthrow was never ending. Forests once lush lay in ash. Mountains split into canyons echoing with the clash of steel and warcries. <br /> <br /> Lands lay barren from sucking resources dry. But the Primordial Titans could not see this world that they created. Driven by power, they did not rest in this eternal battle. They did not see the world was being ravaged into destruction. And continuing on this path could only lead to one result: complete annihilation.",
  "loreChapter6Description": "The constant warring shook the tectonic plates, creating fractures throughout the world. Through these fissures emerged thousands of new Titans. Born into battle, they are known as Battle Titans with traits from both Chaos and Order. <br /> <br /> The great shaking woke the Elementals. Their utopia had been corrupted by the unquenchable thirst for power. They knew it was time to fix things.",
  "loreChapter7Description": "Having recouped only a fraction of their ultimate strength, the Elementals could not restart things and undo the injustices. So they crafted a new world, a world that could withstand endless epic battles. The Titans began to call this place Ereo meaning “new home”. Ereo is the place that you are standing right now. <br /> <br /> Mustering every ounce of power of their remaining power, the Elementals teleported the Primordial and Battle Titans to Ereo. Falling back into a deep slumber, the Elementals had no idea of the new home they had created. ",
  "loreChapter8Description": "With unparalleled dynamic landscapes for intrepid clashes and natural resources to build superior weapons and tools, Ereo has become the greatest battlefield since the dawn of time. You now have the power of the Battle Titans. <br /> <br /> Will you shift the world towards Order or Chaos? Welcome to the Battle of Ereo.",

  "titanDescription1": "Not even the mountains of Ereo, strong as diamonds, are a match for the power of Toruk. Their structure allows them to destroy anything and anyone through brute force.\n\n\nAppearances are deceiving, however. When not in battle, Toruk writes epics and songs in the ravines of Ereo. Their horns serve as a great tool for chiseling beautiful words on the stone walls.",

Their superior vision allows them to find their enemies from afar and hit critical strikes.\n\n\nAccording to legend, Ereo’s first gust of wind was made when Pegor opened their wings for the first time.\n\n\nTheir wings wrap around them when not in battle creating a beautiful cape made of feathers. With flawless flight abilities, they live in the suspended forests of Ereo, away from ambushes.\n\n\nPegor, always on the hunt, never the hunted, believes that nature should obey a hierarchy, fighting so everyone knows their place in the great pyramid of life: with them on the top.",
  "titanDescription3": "In the swamps of Ereo, crawling between trees and admiring their own beauty in the dirty, shallow waters is Mali.\n\n\nAt the hands of a curse, Mali only has eyes for themselves, eternally in love with their own distorted image, invading all of their mental capacity.\n\n\nIn this constant state of insanity and agony, they are unpredictable, fast and ruthless, using their screams of despair as weapons.",
  "titanDescription4": "Vulcor has a simple, yet important job: They spend day and night controlling the temperature of Ereo, using their power of fire and lightning to keep the furnaces working.\n\n\nThey have immense power, but a different desire than other CryptoTitans, they just want to live in solitude.\n\n\nVulcor keeps to themself, isolating in the volcanoes, and over time, this solitude has turned them into an angry and impulsive being.\n\n\nWhen the smoke of Ereo’s volcanoes blocks out the sun, Vulcor is preparing to fight.",
  "titanDescription5": "Korak was born as the weakest of all CryptoTitans and, because of that, wasn’t taken seriously by the others. They refused to fight such an insignificant being.\u200B\n\n\nShunned by the rest of the world, Korak found their place in the jungles of Ereo, connecting with the animals, training with nature’s biggest beasts to better their skills. Through this, Korak became strong and fearless.",
  "titanDescription6": "Blubo believes in the supremacy of the sea over land. Although a fierce ground opponent, their speed underwater is unmatched.\n\n\nBy using bubbles that affect the vision and mind of their opponents, Blubo creates illusions that give them an advantage during battle.\n\n\nSpread across the ocean floor you can find their treasures and trophies, acting as mementos of victories.\n\n\nTake advantage of the seas, and you will cross paths with the terror that is Blubo.",
  "titanDescription7": "Vespir is a winged terror, representing everything that is ominous in the underbelly of the insect world.\n\n\nTheir wings allow them to fly at an unbelievable speed, with risky maneuvers, making it easy for them to get in and out of battle unnoticed.\n\n\nTheir Venomous claws and fangs incapacitate and paralyze their victims.\n\n\nThis resulted in Vespir becoming hardened, and destroying anyone they could find as revenge.",
  "titanDescription8": "Balig has the ability to outlast any situation. Their scales adapt, harden, and help to control their body temperature. Always ready for battle, they can even create thorns, acting both as an attack and as a defense in battle.\n\n\nAs a traveler by nature, they are a great builder and scavenger, at one with the earth to ensure their survival. Balig operates in stealth mode, shying away from direct combat.\n\n\nThey decided to live in the only place that no one dares tread: the unforgiving deserts of Ereo.\n\n\nNothing can stop them. For those who wish to try their luck, won’t be able to strike before getting trapped by their thorns.",
